This repo provides a script written to automate the procces of sustained twitter search/scraping using the R programming language.

Read the rest of this README.md for more information about the thought procces and use guide. 

I'm not an experienced programmer (neither a native english speaker lol) so feel free to contribue and address issues to the project. 

# Why writing this code? 

The biggest drawback of using the Twitter Developer API for scraping tweets (mainly for research) is the time span limitation. Both the R and Python libraries face this issue of only having access to tweets posted 7-9 days in the past.
