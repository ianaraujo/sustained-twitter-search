# Twitter Scraping Automation

This repo provides a script written to automate the procces of sustained twitter search/scraping using the R programming language.

Read the rest of this README.md for more information about the thought procces and use guide. I'm not an experienced programmer so feel free to contribue and address issues to help me on this project. 

# Why writing this code? 

The biggest drawback of using the Twitter Developer API for scraping tweets and doing research on the field of social sciences is the time span limitation. Both the R and Python libraries that interact with the API face this issue of only having access to tweets posted 7-9 days in the past. This limits the work of researchers that choose this methodology. 

That said, we have two possibilities: 

- Either pay for the "premium" API wich allows you to search the full Twitter arquive;
- Or use this project to automate the scraping of tweets for a long period of time in order to build an extensive database on determined topic.
