# Twitter Scraping Automation

This repo provides a script written to automate the procces of sustained twitter search/scraping using the R programming language.

Read the rest of this README.md for more information about the thought procces and use guide. I'm not an experienced programmer so feel free to contribue and address issues to help me on this project. 

# Why writing this code? 

The biggest drawback of using the Twitter Developer API for scraping tweets (mainly for research) is the time span limitation. Both the R and Python libraries that use the API face this issue of only having access to tweets posted 7-9 days in the past. This limits the researchers possibilities while studing social media using this methodology.
